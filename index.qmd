INvenTree is collating tree inventory datasets from disparate datasets across the country towards syntheses that will benefit ecological research and researchers.


## How?

## Why

Over the last few decades, Indian researchers have published *over 450 papers* using data from tree inventories across a large range of ecosystems.

These data have often been collected **using standard methodologies** and collectively span large space and time ranges. When synthesised, they can provide strong baselines and unmatched insights into Indiaâ€™s ecosystems, beyond the constraints that limit primary ecological data collection. 

**Widening access to these data**, we want to identify gaps and offer broad-scale insights for future forest conservation, management and restoration.
