  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Aims               Climatic factors, such as water stress, and chronic anthropogenic disturbances, such as biomass extraction, influence tropical forest community structure, richness and composition. However, while the individual effects of these two drivers on plant communities are well-studied, their interactive effects are not.                                         Location               We conducted a study in the northern Western Ghats of Maharashtra, India. Moist tropical forests in India's Western Ghats face a dual threat from increasingly erratic precipitation (and consequent water stress) and an intensifying anthropogenic footprint.                                         Methods                                We sampled 120 tree plots (0.05\,ha each) across forests with varying histories of biomass extraction and a gradient of climate water deficit (a proxy for water stress) within a 15,000-km                 2                 landscape. Using generalised linear and mixed-effects models, we tested the influence of chronic disturbance and climate water deficit on overall tree species richness, evergreen and deciduous tree species richness and the proportion of evergreen trees.                                                        Results               We recorded 7001 individual trees belonging to 192 species. Tree composition varied across disturbance and elevation categories. Overall and evergreen tree species richness were significantly lower, while deciduous tree species richness was higher in repeatedly disturbed forests compared to less disturbed sites. Deciduous tree species richness increased more steeply with increasing water stress in repeatedly disturbed sites. Meanwhile, evergreen species richness increased with decreasing water stress.                                         Conclusions               Overall, we show that chronic disturbance reduces evergreen tree species and favours more widely distributed deciduous species. In the northern Western Ghats, where much of the remaining forest cover is disturbed and dominated by deciduous tree species, the persistence of the evergreen tree flora hinges on protecting existing evergreen forest patches from disturbances and restoring secondary forests with appropriate evergreen tree species.},

  abstract = {Abstract               The Western Ghats in India is one of the eight hottest hotspots of biodiversity in the World. Despite its extensive forest cover and rich biodiversity, the region hosts only nine long-term forest monitoring sites, primarily located in evergreen (8) and deciduous (1) forest types. Notably, tropical semi-evergreen forests (TSEF), a critical forest type in the Western Ghats, remain underrepresented in these monitoring efforts. To bridge this gap, we established a 1-hectare LTM plot in the TSEF of the central Western Ghats (Netravali plot) following the Centre for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) protocol. All woody species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) {$\geq$}1 cm were identified, measured, and tagged within the plot, and soil samples were analyzed for organic carbon content. A total of 84 species, including 11 species endemic to the Western Ghats, were recorded within the 1 ha plot, which is on the higher side of global species richness estimates. Tree density was 5,395 individuals/ha, with 866 adult trees contributing a basal area of 33.6 m2 ha-1, exceeding the pantropical average of 32 m2 ha-1. The forest plot exhibited an aboveground biomass (AGB) of 289.4 Mg ha-1 and a total carbon stock of 241.75 MgC ha-1, well within the range of global TSEF estimates. SOC was estimated to be 79.4 MgC ha-1, consistent with Asian tropical forest estimates. The forest plot exhibited an inverted J-curve regeneration pattern, indicating a good overall regeneration, although several species, including one endemic, showed poor or no regeneration, necessitating targeted monitoring and conservation efforts. This study highlights the critical need to establish additional LTM sites across diverse ecosystems to support habitat conservation and safeguard biodiversity effectively.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Aims               Savannas are mixed tree-grass systems maintained by complex interactions and feedbacks between bottom-up (resources) and top-down (e.g., fire and herbivory) forces. Much research in savannas has focused on understanding what enables tree-grass coexistence. In contrast, tree-tree interactions have received limited attention despite being equally important for determining savanna structure. Tree-tree interactions can be facilitative, or competitive, with differential implications for woody cover and savanna structure. Further, these interactions can change across life stages of woody plants. In this study, we assessed patterns of tree spatial distributions to infer the nature of tree-tree interactions (whether facilitative or competitive) across two life stages, saplings and adults, in an Indian savanna.                                         Location               Mesic savanna in southern India.                                         Methods               We assessed spatial patterns of trees using point pattern analysis and inferred the nature of tree-tree interactions by examining neighbourhood effects, both conspecific and heterospecific, on plant survival and growth across the two life stages.                                         Results               We found that saplings were strongly aggregated while adult trees were randomly distributed. Despite being strongly aggregated, sapling growth and survival over 4\,years were unaffected by neighbours (adults and saplings). Instead, initial size (basal area at first census) was the single best predictor of both sapling growth and survival. In contrast, adult neighbours negatively affected adult tree growth with effects being more pronounced for conspecific neighbours than heterospecifics. Other factors such as drought and fire, although important for sapling and adult performance, did not occur during our study period.                                         Conclusion               Our results suggest that tree-tree interactions in this mesic savanna vary from neutral at the sapling stage to negative at the adult stage. Neighbourhood density influenced adult tree growth but not survival. Suppressive effects of neighbours on adult tree growth, although weak, suggest a potential role for competitive tree-tree interactions in constraining tree cover in Indian mesic savannas.},
