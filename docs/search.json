When synthesised, they can provide strong baselines and unmatched insights into India’s ecosystems, beyond the constraints that limit primary ecological data collection.\nWidening access to these data, we want to identify gaps and offer broad-scale insights for future forest conservation, management and restoration.\nRead our first preprint here"

Consider if your choice of words can be perceived as insulting or discriminatory.\n\nBe mindful of your “air-time”. Be aware of the dynamics of power and privilege, and whether you may be taking advantage of it.\n\nBe mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants and respect their boundaries.\n\nBe aware of and respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue/ host organisation and funding agencies.\n\nMembers are also expected to adhere to INvenTree’s Data Sharing Policy and project specific Collaboration Agreements (will be collaboratively drafted).\n\n\n\nUnacceptable behaviours\n\nHarassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form is unacceptable. Harassment includes speech or behavior that is not welcome or is personally offensive. Behavior that is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another, so use discretion to be sure respect is communicated. Verbal harassment includes comments, epithets, slurs, threats, and negative stereotyping that are offensive, hostile, disrespectful, or unwelcome.\nNon-verbal harassment includes actions or distribution, display, or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, insults, belittles, or shows hostility, aversion, or disrespect toward a group or individual. The use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces or in presentations is also considered harassment.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include—but are not limited to—unwelcome or offensive verbal comments related to age, appearance or body size, employment, career stage, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, individual lifestyle, marital status, national origin, physical or cognitive ability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, race, or religion.\n\nRetaliation and reporting an incident in bad faith both undermine the safe, productive and welcoming environment we are striving to create and will also be subject to consequences."

Even though data from India - representing two-thirds of South Asia and spanning a wide range of tree-based biomes - exists, a barrier to syntheses is the absence of accessible and standardised data. Further, with increasing human footprint across ecosystems, data from Indian landscapes, with their long history of human-nature interactions is a key link to understand the future of tropical forested landscapes. Combining literature searches with manual data retrieval, we assembled INvenTree, the INdia Tree Inventory dataset, the largest meta-dataset of peer-reviewed publications (n = 465) from 1991-2023 on geolocated plot-based tree inventories of multispecies communities from Indian ecosystems, in aggregate covering 4653.64 ha and all of its vegetated biomes. Using the INvenTree dataset, we show extensive sampling across tropical moist and dry forests, the dominant ecosystem types in the country. We also identify ecological and conservation sampling priority regions based on forest cover and loss and set a blueprint for future sampling efforts in the country. However, most studies are small scale (median = 2 ha) and data across studies is not openly accessible (73.33 % of studies representing 83.43% of the sampled area), potentially hindering inclusion into regional or global syntheses. Significantly, we show majority authorship from within the country; 82.8% of corresponding authors were from India and 73.33% of the studies had all authors affiliated with Indian institutions. Based on extensive Indian scholarship in forest ecology showcased through the INvenTree dataset, we see opportunity for regional collaboration to create scientific inferences that are larger and scalable, while prioritising data and knowledge equity. Harmonising these datasets would contribute enormously to understanding the human dimension of tropical ecology as well as informing regional management and conservation.\nComing soon….\n\nRead a summary\nDownload full dataset\nExplore data"
